              <p>
                All my life, I have had a passion for food.
              </p>
              <p>
                My professional culinary journey began with 'Quarantine Cuisine', a bespoke private dining venture I started in Singapore over COVID-19 in my own home. Throughout this venture, I served over 100 guests, including US embassy personnel, pilots stuck in quarantine hotels and Michelin-starred chefs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Prior to college, I worked as a chef in New York, helping 63 Clinton, as one of 5 chefs, earn its first Michelin star, and at 350 Main, a top-rated contemporary American restaurant in Park City, Utah.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most recently, I worked in the local fine-dining restaurant in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, while attending Bucknell University.
              </p>
              <p>
                These experiences enabled me to refine my skills in the culinary arts, expand my pallet, and create new dishes. Now, at USC, I hope to make a difference once again.
